# TODO

### 1. Define the Objective
- [X] Specify the purpose of the database: Collect images of everyday objects and classify them by their geometric shapes.
- [X] Identify data sources: Determine the websites or platforms that have the desired images, such as image banks, retail sites, e-commerce, etc.

### 2. Planning
- [ ] Establish a scraping plan: Decide which sites will be targeted, which specific pages, and what types of images will be collected.
- [ ] Verify legality and ethics: Ensure that scraping is allowed on the target sites and that you comply with the terms of service and privacy regulations.

### 3. Tools and Technologies
- [ ] Choose scraping tools: Use tools such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, or Puppeteer.
- [ ] Set up the development environment: Install Python, necessary libraries, and configure IDEs such as VSCode or Jupyter Notebook.

### 4. Scraper Implementation
- [ ] Develop the scraper:
  - [ ] Use scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup/Scrapy) to extract URLs of the images.
  - [ ] Use Selenium or Puppeteer for sites with dynamic content.
- [ ] Extract image URLs: Search for `<img>` tags or other HTML tags where the images are located.
- [ ] Download Images: Use the `requests` or `urllib` library to download the images and save them locally or in a cloud storage service.

### 5. Data Storage
- [ ] Organize the images: Create an organized folder structure to store images by geometric shape categories (spheres, cubes, cylinders, etc.).
- [ ] Metadata: Collect and store relevant information (title, description, tags, collection date, source).
- [ ] Database: Use a database (SQL or NoSQL) to store metadata and image paths.

### 6. Cleaning and Filtering
- [ ] Remove duplicates: Implement techniques to identify and remove duplicate images.
- [ ] Quality check: Filter out low-quality or irrelevant images.

### 7. Classification by Geometric Shape
- [ ] Manual or automated classification: Categorize the images by their geometric shapes using manual methods or computer vision and machine learning algorithms for automation.

### 8. Automation and Scalability
- [ ] Automate the process: Use schedulers like `cron` (Linux) or `Task Scheduler` (Windows) to run the scraper periodically.
- [ ] Error handling: Implement logs and alerts to monitor scraper performance and handle errors.
- [ ] Scalability: Adapt the scraper to handle large volumes of data and multiple sources simultaneously.

### 9. Validation and Testing
- [ ] Test the scraper: Verify that the scraper is collecting the correct data.
- [ ] Manual validation: Inspect a sample of the collected images to ensure quality and relevance.
